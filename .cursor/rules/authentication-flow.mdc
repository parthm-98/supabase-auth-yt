# Authentication Flow Implementation Plan

## Overview
Integrate Google authentication with Supabase in the expense tracker app without breaking existing functionality.

## Implementation Steps (Incremental)

### Phase 1: Setup & Documentation âœ…
- [x] Create authentication flow documentation
- [x] Set up Google OAuth in Supabase dashboard
- [x] Configure environment variables

### Phase 2: Basic Authentication Components âœ…
- [x] Create login page (`/login`)
- [x] Implement Google OAuth redirect
- [x] Test basic authentication flow

### Phase 3: Integration with Existing App âœ…
- [x] Add authentication check to main page
- [x] Add logout button to top right
- [x] Ensure existing expense functionality remains intact

### Phase 4: User-Specific Data
- [ ] Update database schema with user_id
- [ ] Modify API routes to include user context
- [ ] Implement row-level security

### Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] User profile display
- [ ] Final testing and cleanup

## Current Status
- âœ… Existing expense tracking functionality working
- âœ… Basic project structure in place
- âœ… Authentication integration complete
- ðŸ”„ Ready for user-specific data implementation

## What We've Accomplished
1. **Login Page**: Users can sign in with Google OAuth
2. **Authentication Check**: Main page now requires authentication
3. **Logout Button**: Added to top right with user info display
4. **Preserved Functionality**: All existing expense features work exactly the same
5. **Seamless UX**: Users get redirected appropriately based on auth status

## Next Steps
- Implement user-specific expense storage
- Add row-level security to database
- Test the complete authentication flow

## Notes
- Each phase has been tested independently
- Existing expense functionality remains unchanged
- Authentication flow is working smoothly
- Ready to move to Phase 4: User-Specific Data
